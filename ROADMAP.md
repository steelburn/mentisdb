# MentisDB Roadmap

## Shipped (0.8.2 -> 0.10.8.53)

### 0.10.8.53 - Technical Debt: Sidecar WAL Self-Consistency, CLI Thought Types
- **Vector sidecar WAL brick (issue #20)** — compaction wrote the full-corpus snapshot digest but never rebased the live in-memory WAL head, so the first append past the 32-record threshold made the next chain open fail with `vector sidecar WAL digest chain mismatch`. Because the chain could not be opened, every write and most reads failed until `.wal` was deleted by hand. Compaction now rebases the WAL head, the managed append path rebases at schedule time, and a full snapshot clears any sibling `.wal` before the atomic rename. Unreadable sidecars rebuild from the canonical log instead of aborting the open.
- **CLI `mentisdb add` `thought_type` (issue #17)** — the required `thought_type` was omitted when `--type` was absent, so a plain `mentisdb add "text"` failed with HTTP 422 `missing field thought_type`; `--type note` produced an opaque 400. `add` now defaults to `fact-learned` as documented and validates `--type` locally, listing the valid types. Payload builders extracted and covered by tests.
- **One canonical `ThoughtType` parser** — removed three drifting copies in `server.rs`, `llm.rs`, and `lib.rs`; REST/MCP now accept the previously rejected `Goal` and `LLMExtracted` variants.
- **Fully addressed open issues #17 and #20**; #18 required no code change (standalone `--headless` was fixed in 0.10.1.46).

### 0.10.7.52 - Hotfix: Load 0.10.5 skill registries
- **Skill registry boot crash** — 0.10.6 inserted `SkillVersion.schema_version` in the middle of the bincode record. Existing `mentisdb-skills.bin` files failed to deserialize (`integer N, expected variant index 0 <= i < 2`) and `MentisDbService::new` panicked. 0.10.7 decodes the 0.10.5 V2 layout and rewrites the file on open/migrate.

### 0.10.6.51 - Permanent Skill Delete, Skills Summary, Retrieval Persist/Lock Wins
- **Permanent skill delete** — `SkillRegistry::delete_skill` removes a skill and every version so the same `skill_id` can be re-uploaded as Active. Revoke still keeps an audit row. REST `POST /v1/skills/delete`, MCP `mentisdb_delete_skill`, dashboard `DELETE /dashboard/api/skills/{id}`.
- **Dashboard Skills UX** — summary bar (total / active / revoked / deprecated); Revoke on active/deprecated; Delete / Delete Permanently on revoked list rows and skill detail (type-to-confirm).
- **Vector sidecar WAL** — append writes one integrity-chained `*.json.wal` record (`MDBVWAL1`) instead of rewriting the full JSON snapshot; load replays the WAL; compact every 32 records. Older JSON-only binaries see a stale sidecar and rebuild.
- **Server append lock split** — MCP/REST drop the chain write lock before sidecar WAL and overlay I/O so ranked search can proceed during derived persist. Crate `append_thought` still flushes before return.
- **Implicit-edge first build** — pairwise for N ≤ 128 (exact unit tests); temporary HNSW top-k above that.
- **Hot-path caches** — dashboard reopens a cached chain only when on-disk thought count is ahead; `query_ranked` uses `search_filtered` on the live Exact/HNSW backend; exact cosine uses `select_nth` top-k; adjacency index cached by thought count; stemmer/thesaurus/`ef_search`/webhook client/`bearer-tokens.json` mtime caches; skill persist-by-ref + stored `schema_version`.
- **Docs** — README lifecycle table, rustdoc WAL contract, docs.mentisdb.com user/developer/agent skill-delete + sidecar WAL, cookbook 2.3/3.2, blog + release notes.

### 0.10.5.50 - Search Invalidation Filtering, Bearer Token Write Fix, Token Delete
- **Default search excludes invalidated thoughts** — thoughts targeted by later `Supersedes`, `Corrects`, or `Invalidates` relations are hidden from `query`, ranked search, context bundles, recent context, and related REST/MCP surfaces. Opt in with `include_invalidated=true` for audit; `as_of` still returns what was valid at that timestamp.
- **Bearer single-chain write fix** — chain-scoped tokens authorize and execute append/import when `chain_key` is omitted by binding the request to the token's only chain (read+write within scope).
- **Permanent bearer-token delete** — dashboard Delete for revoked tokens; CLI `revoke` vs `remove`/`delete`; `POST .../revoke` and `DELETE` permanent.
- **Rust engineer project skills** — house style, concurrency, and Criterion companions under `skills/`.
- **Docs** — invalidation/dedup guidance in README, CLI help, docs.mentisdb.com; Claude second-brain blog post verified against current CLI.
- **Prior items in this cycle** — dashboard chain explorer column alignment; startup migration without full chain loads; `--mode` transport docs.
- Phase 2 gates green (fmt, clippy -D warnings, full test suite). Criterion `search_ranked` smoke + release build; full LoCoMo/LongMemEval not re-run (exclusion filter, not score fusion change).

### 0.10.4.49 - Dashboard Login Fix, Session Lifetime Fix, HNSW Unconditional
- **Dashboard login fix** — the session cookie's `Secure` attribute is now conditional on `X-Forwarded-Proto`, fixing login behind TLS-terminating reverse proxies that talk plain HTTP to the daemon.
- **Session lifetime fix** — replaced `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_SECS * 60` (5 hours, due to a unit mismatch) with an explicit `SESSION_TIMEOUT_SECS` (8 hours), independent of the brute-force rate-limit window.
- **HNSW unconditional** — the `hnsw-backend` Cargo feature has been removed; HNSW is always compiled in. The `HnswBackendNotEnabled` error variant and its test have been deleted.
- **`local-embeddings` is now a default feature** — `cargo install` and the self-updater no longer need `--features local-embeddings`. The Makefile install target, `build_cargo_install_args`, and the non-interactive update messages have been simplified.

### 0.10.3.48 - HNSW Approximate Vector Search, Background Builds, and HNSW Runtime Tuning
- **HNSW approximate-nearest-neighbor vector backend** — unconditionally compiled since 0.10.4.49. The exact f32 cosine scan remains the fallback for small sidecars; once a managed sidecar exceeds `MENTISDB_HNSW_THRESHOLD` (default 50,000 vectors) MentisDB switches to a pure-Rust HNSW graph automatically. The public API and hybrid/ranked search semantics are unchanged.
- **HNSW graph persistence** — built graphs are serialized to disk and reloaded on startup when the vector count matches; stale graphs are deleted during a from-scratch rebuild. Writes are atomic (temp file + rename) so readers never see partial state.
- **Background HNSW construction** — `MENTISDB_HNSW_BACKGROUND_BUILD` (default true) starts an Exact placeholder immediately and builds the graph off-thread, then swaps it into the cached sidecar when ready. Dashboard `backend_kind` and `backend_building` expose the current state.
- **HNSW runtime knobs** — `MENTISDB_HNSW_THRESHOLD`, `MENTISDB_HNSW_EF_CONSTRUCTION`, `MENTISDB_HNSW_EF_SEARCH`, and `MENTISDB_HNSW_BACKGROUND_BUILD` are surfaced in Dashboard Settings and read on demand.
- **Scale benchmark** — `benches/hnsw_scale.rs` measures build time, recall@10, and per-query latency at 50k/100k/1M vectors (100k/1M opt-in via env var).
- **Removed experimental quantized HNSW** — raw f32 HNSW outperformed the quantized prototype on both recall and latency, so the quantized path was deleted.

### 0.10.1.46 - Built-in Bearer Token Auth, TLS Cert CLI, and Search-First Discipline
- **Built-in bearer-token authentication** — `MENTISDB_BEARER_TOKEN_ACCESS=true` protects Streamable HTTP MCP and legacy HTTP MCP routes with `Authorization: Bearer ...`; tokens stored as SHA-256 hashes only. Prerequisite for any non-loopback HTTPS MCP/REST deployment.
- **Scoped bearer-token registry and CLI** — operators issue global tokens (`mentisdb bearertoken create --global <alias>`) or chain-scoped tokens (`--chain <chain>...`); chain-scoped tokens restricted to their chain set; server-wide tools require global token.
- **Dashboard Bearer Tokens page** — dedicated nav page with feature toggle, alias input, Global/Chains radio controls, multi-chain selector, one-time token display with copy-to-clipboard, token table, and revoke action.
- **Settings page enhancements** — edits `MENTISDB_BEARER_TOKEN_ACCESS` and adds Restart Daemon button for environment changes requiring restart.
- **`mentisdb cert` CLI** — mints self-signed TLS certificates with custom SAN sets, writes `MENTISDB_TLS_CERT`/`MENTISDB_TLS_KEY` to `.env`, supports `--force`, `--reset`, `--out-dir`, `--env-file`, `--no-env-update`; prints SAN list and SHA-256 fingerprint for `openssl` cross-check.
- **Comprehensive `--help`** — `mentisdb --help` prints daemon + all subcommand help in one view; subcommand-specific help works as expected.
- **Search-first discipline in MENTISDB_SKILL.md** — prominent "🔎 SEARCH BEFORE YOU WRITE" section with routine (`recent_context` → `ranked_search` → tighten with filters) and three decisions per append; "Blind appends" anti-pattern documented.
- **Library TLS cert API** — `ensure_tls_cert_with_sans(cert, key, extra_sans, overwrite) -> TlsCertArtifacts` exposed for library consumers and CLI; `ensure_tls_cert` is now a one-line wrapper.
- **`--headless` top-level flag** — `mentisdb --headless` starts HTTP/MCP/REST servers without TUI; listed in `--help`.
- **TUI auto-headless fix** — daemon auto-promotes to headless HTTP mode when stdin/stdout not a TTY, eliminating 100% CPU spin on `docker run` without `-t`, `nohup`, `systemd` without `StandardInput=tty`, `cron`, and SSH disconnect.
- **Restore idempotency** — local registries preserved during cross-instance restores; verified same-chain suffixes appended; divergent same-name chains imported under renamed keys; `--overwrite` only for same-path chain file replacement when safe suffix merge not possible.
- **Token prefix cleanup** — generated token secrets use `mentisdb_` prefix instead of `mdb_live_`.
- **Refactored cert CLI** — collapsed duplicated `writeln!` blocks into named helpers; help text single source of truth consumed by both `mentisdb cert --help` and `mentisdb --help`.
- **Docs: TLS Certificates section** — new README section with six worked examples, options table, restart note, `openssl s_client` cross-check; docs.mentisdb.com user_docs.rs and agent_docs.rs updated.
- **Full release engineering pipeline followed** — Phases 1–5 with benchmarks skipped per operator request, Phase 4 code review, granular docs commits.

### 0.9.9 - Automatic Thesaurus + Validated Retrieval Quality
- **Thesaurus now applies automatically by default** to all ranked search (REST, MCP, dashboard, CLI, benchmarks) — no client changes required
- Static thesaurus (~900 headwords + 300+ lemmas) + irregular verb lemmatization now fires transparently on every text query via `apply_thesaurus_if_text` in the server
- Real benchmark validation with full embeddings: LoCoMo-10P R@10 reached the target **72.6%**; LongMemEval R@5 at 66.8% (thesaurus delivered clear gains on vocabulary-mismatch and multi-hop cases)
- WHITEPAPER, README, skill file, blog post, and docs.mentisdb.com all updated for the new default behavior
- Full release engineering pipeline followed (Phases 1–5): benchmarks via sub-agents, Phase 4 code review, granular docs commits

### 0.9.8.44 - Binary Rename, Dashboard Settings, and Dotenvy
- **Binary rename** — `mentisdbd` → `mentisdb`; all docs, tests, CI, install scripts, and TUI references updated
- **Dashboard chain sizes** — chains table shows human-readable on-disk size per chain; summary bar shows total size, thoughts, agents, and per-index totals
- **Dashboard Settings tab** — edit all 18 `MENTISDB_*` env vars with type-aware controls, reset-to-default per row, apply with `.env` persistence and hot-reload for `auto_flush`; restart-required flag for network/storage changes
- **Dotenvy support** — loads environment variables from `.env` in the working directory at startup; shell env takes precedence; silently ignored when absent
- **TUI improvements** — Storage Location column shows chain file size in brackets; running status includes daemon PID

### 0.9.7.43 - Dashboard Skill Editing and Stdio Reliability
- **Dashboard skill editing** - operators can edit skills from the Skills table or a skill detail page; saving creates a new immutable version through the existing upload path and preserves uploader identity/source format
- **Version-correct detail edits** - the skill detail page defaults to the latest version and edits the version currently being viewed; missing version UUIDs return 404 instead of 500
- **Rendered skill Markdown hardening** - dashboard link rendering escapes labels/hrefs, allowlists http/https/mailto, and renders unsafe links as plain text
- **Stdio reliability** - strict MCP clients no longer receive synthetic notification acknowledgements, and background daemon launch uses headless HTTP mode
- **Primer consistency** - the agent primer now uses `use mentisdb as your memory system` across TUI, mentisdb.com, and docs.mentisdb.com

### 0.9.6.42 — SSE, bind_host, Agent-Scoped Context
- **SSE on MCP servers** — `start_mcp_server` and `start_https_mcp_server` return `(ServerHandle, SseBroadcaster)`; GET endpoint serves `text/event-stream` with live MCP events; POST auto-broadcasts JSON-RPC results/errors as SSE events; cloudllm_mcp 0.3.0
- **bind_host parameter** — `standard_mcp_router` accepts `bind_host` (via `MENTISDB_BIND_HOST` env var, default `127.0.0.1`); binds to `0.0.0.0` for Docker containers and multi-homed machines
- **Agent-scoped recent context** — `mentisdb_recent_context` accepts optional `agent_id` parameter; when set, returns the last N thoughts from that agent, not the chain's last N overall

### 0.9.5.41 — MCP 2025-11-25 + Hermes Native Integration
- **MCP 2025-11-25 protocol support** — cloudllm_mcp upgraded to 0.2.1; initialize handshake negotiates "2025-11-25"; conditional Origin validation on streamable HTTP servers
- **Hermes native MentisDB MemoryProvider** — Nous Research's Hermes agent ships a direct memory plugin against the MentisDB MCP tools; first third-party agent integration without an MCP bridge
- **Dashboard fix** — "+Bootstrap New Chain" and "↺ Refresh" buttons restored after a one-shot guard bug dropped their click handlers during page transitions

### 0.9.4.40 — Search Speed-Up, Dashboard Perf, Read Sounds
- **Incremental LexicalIndex** — ranked search queries no longer rebuild the full BM25 index on every call; index is built once at chain open and updated incrementally on append. `query_ranked_lexical_content` drops from ~35 ms to ~237 µs (99.3% faster) on a 5K-thought chain.
- **Per-read-operation audio feedback** — when `MENTISDB_THOUGHT_SOUNDS=true`, every logged read command (search, list_chains, get_thought, etc.) plays a unique 60–150 ms sine-wave chime in the 2.5–4.5 kHz range. Write sounds remain square-wave at 250 Hz–1 kHz. You can tell read from write by ear.
- **Dashboard Agents page loads instantly** — two-phase loading: skeleton renders from the fast chain registry, then parallel per-chain agent fetches populate each section independently. Eliminates the serial O(chains × thoughts) blocking that made the page unusable with many chains.
- **Dashboard table alignment fix** — Recent Thoughts table on the agent detail page had misaligned columns (date under Content, Branch button under Date). Fixed.

### 0.9.3.39 — Ratatui TUI + Clipboard + Streamable HTTP Passthrough
- ratatui 0.30.0 TUI — live three-pane dashboard (server info, endpoints & TLS, tabbed tables for Chains/Agents/Skills, scrollable event log) with Tab/Shift+Tab pane cycling, vim-style contextual hint bar, and RAII terminal cleanup
- drag-to-select copies any text — drag the mouse across any content in any pane; on mouse release the selected rectangle is read directly from ratatui's render buffer and written to clipboard via arboard + OSC 52 (enables native Cmd+C in iTerm2, Terminal.app, kitty, WezTerm); real-time selection highlight via REVERSED cell style overlay
- 'c' key explicit copy — copies the focused item (chain key, agent ID, skill name, primer paste line, visible log lines) with a 2-second green toast confirmation
- seamless single-TUI lifecycle — one TUI for the entire daemon lifetime; no flash between startup progress overlay and running state
- startup crash overlay — startup failures shown as a red full-screen overlay with scrollable log, keeping TUI alive until the user quits
- agent primer panel — "Prime your agent" panel with single paste line for AI chat clients
- Streamable HTTP passthrough — stdio proxy forwards all JSON-RPC to `POST /` on the daemon's Streamable HTTP endpoint; full MCP protocol transparent to all MCP clients
- log panel newest-first display — most recent entries always visible at top; correct auto-scroll pinned to newest, not oldest
- chain key and skill name columns auto-sized to longest entry — no truncated names
- update dialog — centered modal when a newer GitHub release is available

### 0.9.2.38 — Smart Stdio Mode
- stdio smart daemon detection — `mentisdb --mode stdio` auto-detects a running daemon and proxies to it, or launches one in the background when none is found; falls back to local mode only if launch fails
- smart stdio mode — Claude Desktop / Cursor users no longer need to pre-start `mentisdb &` before launching the MCP client; the stdio subprocess handles daemon lifecycle transparently
- MCP-REST split brain fix — stdio proxy forwards `tools/list` and `tools/call` to the daemon's HTTP MCP endpoints so all clients share the same live in-memory chain cache
- `start_servers` shared service — single `MentisDbService` instance is shared across REST, HTTP-MCP, and stdio surfaces instead of each transport instantiating its own

### 0.9.1 — The Full-Feature Release
- Federated cross-chain search — `BranchesFrom` walks ancestor chains; ranked search transparently queries branch + ancestors
- Opt-in LLM extraction — GPT-4o (or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint) extracts structured `ThoughtInput` from raw text; review-before-append workflow
- pymentisdb Python client — full `MentisDbClient` on PyPI; LangChain `MentisDbMemory`; typed enums and relations
- Webhooks — HTTP POST callbacks on thought append with exponential backoff retries
- Wizard brew-first setup — interactive setup detects Homebrew `mcp-remote` and writes Claude Desktop config automatically

### 0.8.9 — Webhooks + Benchmark Stability
- Webhook delivery for thought append events (async HTTP callbacks with retry)
- Irregular verb lemma expansion in lexical search

### 0.8.8 — Episode Provenance + LLM Reranking
- `source_episode` field — full lineage from derived fact to source
- `DerivedFrom` relation kind
- Optional LLM reranking — pluggable cross-encoder reranker interface

### 0.8.7 — Custom Ontology
- `entity_type` field on thoughts (e.g. "bug_report", "architecture_decision")
- Per-chain entity type registry persisted in a sidecar
- Dashboard entity_type display and filter

### 0.8.6 — Search Quality + Branching
- Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) — opt-in reranking merging lexical + vector + graph signals
- Memory branching — `BranchesFrom` relation; `POST /v1/chains/branch`
- Per-field BM25 DF cutoffs — document-frequency-based field weighting
- Irregular verb lemma expansion (~170 mappings, query-time only)

### 0.8.2 — Temporal, Dedup, Scopes, CLI
- Temporal facts — `valid_at`/`invalid_at` on thoughts; `as_of` query parameter
- Memory deduplication — Jaccard similarity threshold; auto-`Supersedes` relation
- Multi-level memory scopes — `MemoryScope` enum (`User`, `Session`, `Agent`)
- CLI tool — `mentisdb add`, `search`, `list`, `agents`, `chain` subcommands

## What Is HNSW? (And Why MentisDB Needs It)

**HNSW = Hierarchical Navigable Small World graphs**

It is the dominant algorithm for *approximate nearest neighbor search* (ANNS) at scale. Pinecone, Qdrant, Weaviate, Milvus, Vespa, and OpenSearch all use HNSW or variants.

### The Problem
Exact cosine search over 10M vectors of dimension 1536 requires ~60 GB RAM and scans take seconds. Linear scan doesn't scale.

### The HNSW Idea
Build a multi-layer graph where:
- **Layer 0** = all vectors, connected to ~16-64 nearest neighbors (dense connectivity)
- **Layer 1** = subset (~1/4), longer-range connections
- **Layer 2** = subset of layer 1, even longer range
- ...
- **Top layer** = few entry points, global navigation

Search starts at the top layer, greedily walks toward the query vector, drops down a layer, repeats. Typical hops: 50-200 total distance computations vs 10M for brute force.

### Key Parameters
- `M` = max connections per node (default 16-48). Higher = better recall, more memory.
- `efConstruction` = search width during index build (default 100-400). Higher = better graph quality, slower build.
- `efSearch` = search width at query time (default 50-200). Higher = better recall, slower query.

### Why MentisDB Needs It
| Current | With HNSW |
|---------|-----------|
| Linear scan, exact cosine | Sublinear graph search, ~95-99% recall |
| ~50k vectors practical | 10M+ vectors practical |
| p95 ~200ms at 50k | p95 ~10-50ms at 1M+ |
| Memory: 4 bytes × dim × N | Memory: ~1.1× vectors + graph edges |

### Integration Path for MentisDB
1. **Keep exact f32 as reference** — never lose deterministic, auditable search
2. **HNSW as a `VectorSearchBackend` implementation** — same trait, swapped implementation; shipped in 0.10.3.48 and enabled by default
3. **Quantized HNSW** — deferred; raw f32 HNSW outperformed the quantized prototype on both recall and latency
4. **Filter-aware search** — HNSW with bitmap/pre-filter support (MentisDB's filter-first model maps well)
5. **Incremental build** — HNSW supports online inserts; deletes via tombstone + periodic rebuild

### Rust Crates Evaluated
- `hnsw` — selected for the 0.10.3.48 backend; pure Rust, no BLAS, no_std-friendly core, serde support for persistence
- `arroy` — used by Meilisearch, supports mmap, incremental
- `vectorsearch` — newer, SIMD-optimized
- Or wrap `faiss`/`hnswlib` via FFI (heavier deps)

**Decision**: Prototype `hnsw` crate behind feature flag after cookbook v1. Benchmark against exact f32 at 100k, 1M, 10M. Target: ≥95% recall@10 with <50ms p95 at 1M vectors.

## What's Changed Since April 10

MentisDB closed 15+ feature gaps in 11 releases (0.8.2 → 0.9.1). The original competitive analysis identified temporal facts, memory dedup, multi-level scopes, CLI, and episode provenance as major gaps. All shipped.

New unique advantages since April 10:
- Federated cross-chain search (no competitor has this)
- Skill registry with versioning and revocation
- Webhooks
- Opt-in LLM extraction (keeps no-LLM core as differentiator)

New competitive threats:
- **Hindsight** — independently verified SOTA benchmarks; managed service
- **Cognee v1.0** — 15k stars, graph-based memory
- **Hermes** — open-source agent by Nous Research; now natively integrated with MentisDB via MemoryProvider
- **LangMem** — default in LangGraph Platform deployments; massive distribution advantage

The next battle is ecosystem and distribution, not features.
